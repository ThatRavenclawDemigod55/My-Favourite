   <p id="bio"> My Favourite book series is really hard to chose, as I love reading so much, but I think I would chose the Heroes of Olympus series by Rick Riordan. The story is about 7 American demigods (half god-half human) as they travel from America to Greece to stop the evil earth mother, Gaia, from awakening and destroying the world. For a bigger description, go to plot. I really love these books as it is full of humor, fantasy and action. I found out about this series when my friend reccommended Rick Riordan's first series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians. It was amazing and I loved it so much that it inspired me to read most of Rick Riordans books, including this series. Rick Riordan is one of my favourite writers, and i plan to read every one of his books! As these books are based of lots of Greek Mythology, I have a extensive knowledge of it. To finish I would like to say that these books have been so brilliant that it has spurred me on to write my own book! </p>
